# Thabo Makhubele's Cloud Portfolio Website

This repository hosts the code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills in Azure administration, cloud solutions, and web development.

# Problem

In today's competitive job market, especially for cloud roles, a strong, accessible online presence is essential. I needed a professional platform to:

Consolidate and present my diverse cloud projects and hands-on experience.

Clearly highlight my technical skills and Azure certifications.

Provide recruiters and potential employers with a centralized, engaging overview of my capabilities.

Demonstrate practical application of cloud hosting and CI/CD principles.

# Solution

I designed and developed a responsive web portfolio using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and deployed it on Azure Static Web Apps. The solution incorporates:

Azure Static Web Apps: Leveraging this service for high-performance, globally distributed hosting of the static site.

GitHub Actions for CI/CD: A robust automated pipeline was configured. Any code changes pushed to the main branch of this GitHub repository automatically trigger a build and deployment to the live Azure environment, ensuring rapid and continuous updates.

Custom Domain & SSL: Integrated a personalized domain (thabomakhubel.cloud) and secured all traffic with SSL/TLS, demonstrating best practices for web presence.

Azure Application Insights: Set up for basic live monitoring, providing insights into site performance and usage.

# Result

The creation of this portfolio website resulted in:

A fast, secure, and globally available platform that effectively showcases my cloud projects and technical expertise.

Enhanced visibility to recruiters and potential clients, providing tangible evidence of my practical Azure hosting and web development skills.

A practical demonstration of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) principles, highlighting my ability to automate and manage modern web deployments on Azure.

A testament to my commitment to learning and applying cloud technologies in real-world scenarios.
